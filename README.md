# Radial Menu with Interactive Scroll

This project demonstrates how to create a radial menu in HTML and JavaScript, where each menu item represents a different color. Users can interact with the menu by touching and rotating it, and the background color of the page changes based on the selected menu item. Additionally, the project includes functionality to scroll specific content up and down based on the rotation direction of the radial menu.

## Features

- **Radial Menu**: The main feature of the project is the radial menu, consisting of five menu items, each representing a different color (blue, red, yellow, pink, and green).
- **Interactive Rotation**: Users can interact with the menu by touching and rotating it horizontally. The menu rotates smoothly based on touch input, and the selected menu item changes dynamically as the rotation angle changes.
- **Background Color Change**: As the user rotates the menu, the background color of the page changes to match the color of the selected menu item.
- **Interactive Scroll**: The project includes functionality to scroll specific content up and down based on the rotation direction of the radial menu. When the user rotates the menu clockwise (clockwise), the content scrolls up (down), and vice versa.
